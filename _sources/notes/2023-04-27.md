## Concept Review
See prismia questions


## Logistics 

- All work submitted by **May 1** will be reviwed by May 8
- All work must be submitted by **May 10**, icluding revisions
- I created a [calculator tool](https://introcompsys.github.io/whatif/lab/index.html) to check scenarios about what different badge combinations will result in your final grade 
- last minute [community badge](https://github.com/introcompsys/spring2023/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acommunity) opportunities
- [complete the idea survey](https://uri.campuslabs.com/eval-home/direct/5410324) for the [incentive](incentive)
