 (optional, community badge opportunity) Try out the Pycharm extenstion created by one of your classmates as a build badge. You can download it by searching "gcc integration" in pycharm directly in the plugin marketplace or by [following the  instructions on the documentation website](https://mike-fmh.github.io/gcc-integration/#installation). If you succeed, comment on your prepare issue with which technique (pluging marketpalce or manual) you used to install it  and tag Professor Brown.  If it does not work, open an [issue](https://github.com/mike-fmh/gcc-integration/issues) that describes what you did, what happened, and what you expected instead and link to that issue on your prepare issue and tag Professor Brown for the community badge. (write a long full review of the extension comparing it to similar available tools for an explore badge)
