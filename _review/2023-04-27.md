**integrative-3**
Write multiple 10 choice questions that assess understanding of terminology from after spring break your KWL repo in a file `final-vocab.md`. 

Each question should have 4 options, 1 correct and 3 that represent a reasonable, but incorrect idea someone may have. Questions may check understanding of key *concepts* or  *terminology*. For each option explain why it is/not correct in a way that would help clarify someone's confusion if they had picked that answer instead of the correct answer. Use the following syntax(correct answer can be in any position):
